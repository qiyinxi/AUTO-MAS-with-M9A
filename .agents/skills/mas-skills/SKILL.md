# MAS Skills

## Objective
Provide one routing entrypoint for MAS engineering standards and keep implementation decisions consistent with current project maintainer review preferences.

## Repository Authority

AUTO-MAS splits responsibilities across repositories:

1. `AUTO-MAS-Project/AUTO-MAS` keeps application code and a minimal `AGENTS.md` entrypoint.
2. `AUTO-MAS-Project/AUTO-MAS-docs` / <https://doc.auto-mas.top/developer/> owns branch, contribution, commit, version, Issue, and PR writing rules.
3. Local `.agents/skills` owns the project-affiliated Agent Skill behavior and engineering routing rules for this checkout.

When these areas overlap, use this skill for engineering decisions and use the docs site for contribution-process decisions.

## Project Rule Areas
Apply these project rules directly when they overlap with a task:

1. Cherry-picks to an already released `release/{version}` branch must be small **pure-backend** fixes that touch no frontend code, because released apps hot-update only backend code from that branch while the frontend ships inside the installer. Cherry-picking a commit that carries frontend logic is a violation: close the related PR and revert the related commit. Judge by the files the commit actually touches, not by the `type` / `scope` in its message. Never help prepare or push such a cherry-pick.
2. API work follows the schema-first route flow: define `app/models/schema.py`, wire the matching `app/api/` module, then regenerate frontend API clients.
3. Config work follows `ConfigBase` and `ConfigItem` ownership: declare fields before `super().__init__()`, use validators as auto-correction behavior, and register multi-config classes in the owning collection.
4. Script adaptation must be complete across config, schema, API, task dispatch, task folder, and frontend entry points, and must respect the black-box boundary: lower the configuration barrier before filling any gap, then decide capability ownership: work the script owns (in-game actions, task execution and verdicts, script config semantics) may only be reused through upstream entry points; when upstream lacks such work, consider contributing it upstream first and only fill in inside MAS as a temporary measure (marked for removal once upstream ships it) when that is not viable; MAS-owned domains (accounts, scheduling, plans, notifications, statistics, emulator lifecycle, cross-script orchestration) may be implemented in MAS but must not read or infer upstream internal state; upstream private formats may only be passed through, never modeled on, and no self-invented verdicts for upstream-executed tasks. Once upstream ships an entry point for such work, existing implementations become violations and must be replaced by reuse. After this skill is loaded, self-check the task and, on a hit, report "This may violate the MAS development norms" with file:line evidence and an alternative; the warning does not block work. Read `.agents/skills/mas-script-specialized-adapter/references/blackbox-boundary.md` before designing.
5. Frontend work follows the dedicated frontend skills in this directory.
6. Contribution style follows Conventional Commits, Google-style backend docstrings where useful, config-item comments, and keyword arguments for booleans or multi-argument calls.
7. CI must pin every external reference to immutable content: GitHub Actions `uses` entries use a full 40-character commit SHA with a `# <tag>` version comment (resolve annotated tags to the peeled commit), and container images use `@sha256:<digest>`. Apply this across GitHub workflows, composite actions, and CNB pipelines; local actions such as `./.github/actions/...` are the only exception. Never leave a mutable tag, branch, or short hash. When changing CI, scan every `uses:` and `image:` reference and verify that all external references remain pinned.

8. Start every branch from the latest upstream `dev` (`git fetch` first; in a fork, branch off upstream `dev`), never from a stale local `dev`: a branch built on an old baseline silently overwrites other people's merged work when it is synced, with no conflict and green type checks. Branch rules: <https://doc.auto-mas.top/developer/development-specifications.html>.

## Sub-Skills
Use these skills as needed:

1. `mas-frontend-standards`: Vue 3, TypeScript, Vite, Electron renderer, routing, API composables, state, styles, forms, validation, and frontend verification.
2. `mas-frontend-ui`: Ant Design Vue UI, desktop business layout, visual tokens, forms, tables, dialogs, feedback, drag interactions, dark mode, and UX constraints.
3. `mas-code-standards`: project code standards derived from representative `dev` commits and existing AUTO-MAS modules.
4. `mas-schema-naming`: canonical naming for shared schema semantics in future domain work.
5. `mas-module-boundary`: module ownership and dependency direction across backend layers.
6. `mas-function-design`: function-level design for responsibility, signatures, side effects, and errors.
7. `mas-api-contract`: endpoint contract standards for HTTP/WS request-response behavior.
8. `mas-data-model`: modeling standards for schema/config/task layers and compatibility evolution.
9. `mas-script-specialized-adapter`: specialized script integration by script frontend architecture line; requires intake before implementation.
10. `mas-plan-schedule`: plan schedule type registration, backend/frontend plan dispatch, plan combobox consumers, and per-type table integration.
11. `mas-game-sign`: game community sign-in providers, credential encryption and login routes, sign-in locks and trigger paths, and result/notification contracts.

## Global Constraints
Apply these constraints before selecting or combining sub-skills.

1. Make minimal necessary changes first; avoid broad refactors unless explicitly requested.
2. Align with current code style and existing project conventions in the touched module.
3. Avoid over-engineering, over-abstraction, and defensive programming that does not match existing code patterns.
4. Study similar existing implementations deeply before coding and follow established local patterns.
5. Never edit files generated by OpenAPI code generation under any circumstance. If regeneration is needed, explicitly tell the developer to run the generation process manually.
6. For frontend work, load `mas-frontend-standards`; for UI or user-facing component behavior, also load `mas-frontend-ui`.
7. When local patterns and generalized guidance differ, prefer concrete maintainer review comments and fold them back into the selected sub-skills.
8. Before completing a user-visible feature or fix, add exactly one changelog fragment under `changelog.d/` (`<PR number or branch>.<feat|change|fix|breaking|remove|security|dev>.md`; first line `project: <key>` from the project table in `changelog.d/README.md` — 14 adapters plus home / scheduler / emulator / notify / tools / settings / update / runtime, no catch-all, pick the nearest per the README; only `dev` fragments may omit it; then one user-facing sentence of at most 50 characters without project prefix, PR number or signature; `python scripts/changelog.py add <type> <project> "<sentence>"` creates it, with `-` as the project for `dev`). Before writing a fix or change fragment, decide which release introduced the feature you touch: a feature absent from the previous stable release's notes was introduced in the current X.Y.0 cycle (for 5.5.0: Runtime initialization, virtual display, Emulator 2.0, MFW, BetterGI, BAAH, ZZZ-OD, config restore, operator cultivation). Every later fix, maintenance or supplementary change to such a feature (bug fixes, turning something into a prompt, extra hints, default tweaks, layout changes, i18n wiring, cleanup) is beta-only: if the feature's entry is still in the top `## [未发布]` section or its fragment is still in `changelog.d/`, add no fragment and label the PR `skip-changelog` (describe any wording change in the PR for a maintainer to apply); if it shipped in an earlier beta of the cycle, add the header line `beta-only: true` so the entry is dropped from the stable roll-up. Sub-features added to it later are beta-only as well: in the stable notes a new adapter is exactly one line (`【bgi】新增 bgi 专项`) and a new feature is its single introduction entry; fixes and changes to features that shipped in the previous stable are normal. Project keys use the short names `bgi` (BetterGI) and `end` (MaaEnd). A PR with several human authors lists them all in the header line `author: a, b` (the script never reads Co-authored-by). Maintainers may add `highlight: true` to route an entry into 「本次亮点」 as part of the implementation; do not merely remind the developer. Condense all changes of the PR into that one sentence. Never edit `CHANGELOG.md`, `res/version.json` or any version number: they are written only by the release PR. Do not create a commit unless the user explicitly asks for one.

## Routing Rules
Choose sub-skills by task intent.

1. Task mentions field names, shared terms, schema key consistency:
Use `mas-schema-naming`.
2. Task touches `frontend`, `src/views`, `src/components`, `src/composables`, `src/router`, `src/types`, `src/utils`, Vue, TypeScript, Vite, Electron renderer, API composables, forms, validation, or frontend verification:
Use `mas-frontend-standards`.
3. Task touches UI, layout, style, Ant Design Vue, components, forms, tables, modals, drawers, feedback, loading, empty, error states, drag interactions, dark mode, or visual polish:
Use `mas-frontend-ui` with `mas-frontend-standards`.
4. Task implements, fixes, refactors, or reviews repository code:
Use `mas-code-standards` as the baseline, then add the minimum domain-specific `mas-*` skills. Skip it for read-only work unless code conventions or commit wording are requested.
5. Task mentions layer ownership, imports, coupling, or where code should live:
Use `mas-module-boundary`.
6. Task mentions function splitting, signature quality, return/error behavior:
Use `mas-function-design`.
7. Task mentions endpoint payloads, response model, error contract, websocket payloads:
Use `mas-api-contract`.
8. Task mentions model structure, typing/defaults/constraints, migration of model fields:
Use `mas-data-model`.
9. Task mentions adding a new script, script-specific adaptation, task lifecycle, or a specific adapter such as MAA / SRC / MaaEnd / General / Okww / OkNte（异环）/ HSR (M9A is not an adapter: it is a MaaFW flavor, see `app/task/M9A/AGENTS.md`):
Use `mas-script-specialized-adapter` first, then combine `mas-module-boundary`, `mas-data-model`, `mas-function-design`, and `mas-api-contract` as needed.
10. Task mentions commit messages, docstrings, config comments, or project contribution style:
Use `mas-code-standards` for code-style decisions; use the docs site for contribution-process wording.
11. Task mentions plan schedules, schedule types, `PlanConfig`, `PLAN_BOOK`, plan comboboxes, or adding a new plan table:
Use `mas-plan-schedule`.
12. Task mentions game community sign-in, `app/tools/game_sign*`, a sign-in platform such as Skland/Miyoushe/Kuro/Taygedo, sign-in credentials or QR login, or sign-in result and notification behavior:
Use `mas-game-sign`.
13. Task mentions cherry-picking a fix to a `release/{version}` branch, backporting to a released version, or hot-updating released backend code:
Apply the cherry-pick rule in **Project Rule Areas** before touching git; confirm the commit is small and pure backend by inspecting the files it actually touches.

## Combined Execution Order
When multiple concerns appear, apply this order:

1. `mas-frontend-standards`, when the task touches frontend code or docs.
2. `mas-frontend-ui`, when the task touches UI or user-facing component behavior.
3. `mas-code-standards`
4. `mas-module-boundary`
5. `mas-data-model`
6. `mas-schema-naming`
7. `mas-function-design`
8. `mas-api-contract`
9. `mas-script-specialized-adapter` after architecture intake, when the task is a specialized adapter.
10. `mas-plan-schedule`
11. `mas-game-sign`

Reason: frontend tasks need their engineering and UI constraints loaded before implementation decisions; then establish local conventions, place code correctly, stabilize model structure, then naming, function behavior, and transport contract. Specialized adapters add a mandatory architecture-intake step, plan schedule rules apply when the task touches scheduler registration, and game sign rules apply last because they constrain credential handling and external request behavior inside an already-placed module.

## Output Requirements
When using this hub:

1. State which sub-skills are selected.
2. Explain why each selected sub-skill is needed.
3. Apply only the minimum set required by the task.
4. Keep compatibility-first decisions for legacy modules unless explicitly asked to refactor broadly.
5. In review tasks, call out where findings follow known maintainer preferences rather than only generic engineering taste.
6. For Issue/PR body writing, follow the docs site instead of inventing repository-specific text here; the drafting techniques live in the `pr` skill.
7. For frontend tasks, state whether `mas-frontend-standards` and `mas-frontend-ui` were selected and why.

## Review Checklist
1. Selected sub-skills match the user request scope.
2. Frontend tasks loaded the correct frontend skill pair.
3. No layer-boundary violations are introduced.
4. Shared schema semantics remain canonical.
5. Function behavior and API contract stay consistent after changes.
6. Relevant project rules were considered for API, config, script task, frontend task, and contribution-style changes.
7. Contribution-process details were not duplicated from the docs site except as links or brief reminders.
8. Every user-visible feature or fix includes exactly one changelog fragment under `changelog.d/`, and leaves `CHANGELOG.md`, `res/version.json` and the version numbers untouched.
9. Any cherry-pick to a released branch was verified to touch backend files only.
10. Every external CI action and container image is pinned to a full commit SHA or digest, with an updater-readable version comment where applicable; no mutable reference remains.
